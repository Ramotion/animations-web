## Reorganizable List

Reorganizable list displays a list of data which the user may reorder using simple click-and-drag mouse controls. Architecture is modeled by a finite state machine with animated transitions managed by [Greensock](https://greensock.com/), a JS animation library [designed to efficiently animate tweens and timelines](https://ihatetomatoes.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GreenSock-Cheatsheet-4.pdf).
